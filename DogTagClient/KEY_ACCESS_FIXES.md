# Key Access Information Fixes

## Problem Summary

The virtual hardware key system had several critical issues where key access information was not being updated correctly:

1. **`lastAccessedAt` never updated**: The field was only set during initialization and never refreshed when keys were actually accessed
2. **`credentialCount` not refreshed**: Credential counts were calculated on-demand but not cached, leading to slow performance and stale data
3. **No access tracking**: There was no mechanism to track when virtual keys were actually used for operations
4. **Inefficient operations**: Every credential count required mounting/unmounting disk images, which was slow and error-prone

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Metadata Caching System

Added a comprehensive metadata tracking system to `VirtualHardwareKeyManager`:

```swift
private struct VirtualKeyMetadata: Codable {
    let keyId: UUID
    let lastAccessedAt: Date
    let credentialCount: Int
    let lastCountUpdate: Date
}
```

**Features:**
- Persistent metadata cache stored in `.virtual_keys_metadata.json`
- Automatic loading/saving of metadata
- Tracks last access time and credential counts with timestamps
- Cache invalidation after 1 hour for credential counts

### 2. Access Tracking

Updated key operations to properly track access:

**Mount Operations:**
- `mountDiskImage()` now updates access time when a virtual key is mounted
- Generates deterministic UUIDs for consistent tracking

**Export/Import Operations:**
- Updates access time and refreshes credential counts after operations
- Ensures metadata stays current with actual key usage

**Storage Switching:**
- Updates access tracking when switching to virtual storage mode

### 3. Enhanced VirtualHardwareKey Model

Added utility methods to the `VirtualHardwareKey` struct:

```swift
/// Create an updated copy with new access time
public func withUpdatedAccess() -> VirtualHardwareKey

/// Create an updated copy with new credential count
public func withUpdatedCredentialCount(_ count: Int) -> VirtualHardwareKey
```

### 4. Efficient Credential Counting

Implemented smart caching for credential counts:

```swift
private func getCachedCredentialCount(for keyId: UUID, diskImagePath: URL) async -> Int
```

**Benefits:**
- Uses cached counts if less than 1 hour old
- Only recalculates when cache is stale
- Dramatically improves UI responsiveness
- Reduces disk I/O operations

### 5. Manual Refresh Capabilities

Added public methods for manual refresh:

```swift
/// Refresh credential count for a specific virtual key
public func refreshCredentialCount(for keyId: UUID) async throws

/// Refresh credential counts for all virtual keys
public func refreshAllCredentialCounts() async throws
```

### 6. UI Improvements

Enhanced the Virtual Hardware Key interface:

**Global Refresh:**
- Added "Refresh Info" button to refresh all key information
- Updates both access times and credential counts

**Individual Key Refresh:**
- Added "ðŸ”„ Refresh Info" option to each virtual key's context menu
- Allows targeted refresh of specific keys

**Real-time Updates:**
- UI automatically refreshes after import/export operations
- Shows current access times and accurate credential counts

## Technical Details

### Metadata File Location
- Stored alongside virtual keys: `{VirtualKeysDirectory}/.virtual_keys_metadata.json`
- Automatically created and maintained
- Survives app restarts and system reboots

### UUID Generation
Uses deterministic UUID generation based on file path SHA256 hash:
```swift
let pathHash = diskImagePath.path.data(using: .utf8)!
let sha = SHA256.hash(data: pathHash)
// Convert to UUID format...
```

This ensures consistent tracking even if the app restarts.

### Cache Invalidation
- Credential counts expire after 1 hour
- Access times are always current
- Manual refresh bypasses cache

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if metadata file is corrupted
- Non-blocking operations - failures don't break core functionality
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Performance Improvements

### Before Fixes:
- Every UI refresh required mounting all virtual keys
- Slow response times (several seconds per key)
- Frequent disk I/O operations
- Stale information display

### After Fixes:
- Instant UI updates using cached data
- Minimal disk I/O (only when cache is stale)
- Real-time access tracking
- Accurate credential counts

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Updates
```swift
// Access tracking happens automatically
let mountPoint = try await VirtualHardwareKeyManager.shared.mountDiskImage(virtualKey.diskImagePath)
// âœ… lastAccessedAt is automatically updated

// Credential count updates after operations
let count = try await manager.exportCredentialsToVirtualKey(keyId: keyId, credentialIds: ids)
// âœ… credentialCount is automatically refreshed
```

### Manual Refresh
```swift
// Refresh specific key
try await VirtualHardwareKeyManager.shared.refreshCredentialCount(for: keyId)

// Refresh all keys
try await VirtualHardwareKeyManager.shared.refreshAllCredentialCounts()
```

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing virtual keys work without modification
- Metadata is created automatically for existing keys
- No breaking changes to public APIs
- Graceful handling of missing metadata

## Testing

The fixes have been tested for:
- âœ… Compilation without errors
- âœ… Backward compatibility with existing virtual keys
- âœ… Proper metadata persistence
- âœ… UI responsiveness improvements
- âœ… Accurate access time tracking
- âœ… Correct credential count updates

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Real-time sync across multiple app instances
2. More granular cache invalidation
3. Background refresh scheduling
4. Analytics on key usage patterns
5. Export/import of metadata for backup purposes

**Result**: Virtual hardware key access information now updates correctly and efficiently, providing users with accurate, real-time information about their keys while maintaining excellent performance.
